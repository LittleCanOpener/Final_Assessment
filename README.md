<dl><h5>Additional requirements (20%) - Pick one</h5>
  <dt>Multiscreen application </dt>
  <dd>Add a nice looking Home screen that has a "Start Game" button - maybe summary for the rules of the game, or fun gif / design that gets the user excited to
  play. The game starts with randomly picked word / sentence from a list. To learn
  how to create multiscreen applications, check out BMI Calculator section of the
  Flutter course. It also covers some advanced UI design and code structuring!
</dd><hr>
  <dt>Input custom words / sentences</dt>
  <dd>Update the starting screen to allow the user to start the game by receiving a
  word / sentence randomly selected for him, or, they can input the word / sentence themselves. That would allow the user to input his own challenge for others to attempt.</dd><hr>
  <dt>Change difficulty</dt>
  <dd>Change the rules of hangman, to allow the user to attempt to solve using easy, medium or hard mode. Itâ€™s up the the creator to implement those states - but they could include fewer errors allowed, hide some or all of the wrongly guessed characters or randomly remove successfully guessed character so they have to input it again. Dealers choice.</dd><hr>
  <dt>Hints</dt>
  <dd>Allow the user to get a hint of what the word is, at a cost of a failed guess attempt</dd><hr>
  <dt>Other</dt>
  <dd>Anything other that you might think of that would make the game more fun and engaging!</dd><hr>

        <h3>Git</h3><p>
        <img src="assets/images/icons/git.png" width="40px" height="40x"><br>
        Why <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>:<br>
        Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

    <li>
        <h3>Github</h3><p>
        <img src="assets/images/icons/github.png" width="40px" height="40x"><br>
        Why <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>:<br>
        Well It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work

        <img src="assets/images/icons/github-desktop.png" width="40px" height="40x"><br>
        Why <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">Github-Desktop</a>:
        <br>If you're new to Git and GitHub, you may find it easier to use GitHub Desktop than to use Git on the command line. GitHub Desktop has a graphical user interface that simplifies commands and helps you visualize changes.<br>

        <h3>Dart</h3><p>
        <img src="assets/images/icons/dart.png" width="40" height="40"><br>
        Why <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank">Dart</a>:<br>
        Being a compiled language, Dart allows developers to discover programming errors during the compilation process.
        Hence, it is considered a type-safe language.
        On the other hand,
        Java is an interpreted language and allows developers to find programming errors during the runtime.

        <summary>Good to Know about ChatGPT Before Use:</summary>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <strong>Clearly Define Your Task:</strong>
            Clearly articulate your task or question. The more specific and detailed your input, the more focused and relevant the response will be.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Iterative Questioning:</strong>
            If the initial response is not fully satisfying or if you need more details, try asking follow-up questions. This can help you refine your understanding and gather more information on the topic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Provide Context:</strong>
            Offer additional context or background information related to your question. This can help ChatGPT generate more accurate and relevant responses based on the context you provide.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Experiment with Prompt Engineering:</strong>
            Play around with the way you structure your prompts. Sometimes, rephrasing or restructuring the question can lead to better or more informative responses.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Specify the Level of Detail:</strong>
            If you're looking for a broad overview, make that clear. If you need a detailed explanation, specify that in your prompt. Tailoring your requests to the level of detail you seek can enhance the relevance of the responses.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explore Multiple Angles:</strong>
            Ask questions from different perspectives or angles to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. This can help you uncover nuances and different facets of the information
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Verify Information:</strong>
            Use external sources to verify the information provided by ChatGPT. While the model is powerful, it's essential to cross-check the information for accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ask for Clarifications:</strong>
            If a response is ambiguous or unclear, ask for clarifications. This can help you get more precise information and avoid any misunderstandings.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Take Notes:</strong>
            As you interact with ChatGPT, take notes on the information you find valuable. This can help you organize and remember the knowledge you gain during the session.<hr>
        </li>
        <li>
            Remember, while ChatGPT is a powerful tool, it's not infallible. Always verify critical information from reliable sources. Additionally, OpenAI continues to improve and update its models, so staying informed about any new features or changes can enhance your experience.
